# An Analysis on theater kickstarters based on launch date and funding goals

## Overview 
*This document serves the purpose of providing a simple analysis on how theater kickstarters campaigns outcomes are affected by seasonality and the monetary amount they need to be produced. This analysis is composed in two sections; first study compares successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns outcomes on different months of the year. The Second study compares the relationship between a specific category of theater campaigns (Plays) against their funding goals.


## Analysis 

## 1- Theater Campaigns based on launch date

To compare how theater campaigns behaved according to their seasonality it was necessary to modify the time data using basic excel functions to translate the dates into which month and time of the year were created (launch date). Subsequently a table & line plot was built using data on outcomes of different theater production kickstarters and their release date. Seasonality is defined as months of the year and outcomes are divided by canceled, failed & successful. 

To complete the analysis we observed which months of the year most campaigns were most successful and what months campaigns failed the most.  This data has a limitation that canceled campaigns donâ€™t add any important information related to outcome and time or cancellation is not related to time of the month.
