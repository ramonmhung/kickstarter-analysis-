# An Analysis on theater kickstarters based on launch date and funding goals

## Overview 
*This document serves the purpose of providing a simple analysis on how theater kickstarters campaigns outcomes are affected by seasonality and the monetary amount they need to be produced. This analysis is composed in two sections; first study compares successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns outcomes on different months of the year. The Second study compares the relationship between a specific category of theater campaigns (Plays) against their funding goals.


## Analysis 

### 1- Theater campaigns outcomes based on launch date

*To compare how theater campaigns behaved according to their seasonality it was necessary to modify the time data using basic excel functions to translate the dates into which month and time of the year were created (launch date). Subsequently a table & line plot was built using data on outcomes of different theater production kickstarters and their release date. Seasonality is defined as months of the year and outcomes are divided by canceled, failed & successful. 

To complete the analysis we observed which months of the year most campaigns were most successful and what months campaigns failed the most.  This data has a limitation that canceled campaigns donâ€™t add any important information related to outcome and time or cancellation is not related to time of the month.

### 2- Plays campaigns outcomes based on funding goals

*This section of the analysis is based on a subcategory of theater kickstarters (plays). In order to compare the data plays were separated by outcome (Successful, Failed & Live) and different ranges of funding goals. Once the amount of plays in every financial range was defined the percentage of every outcome was calculated. The new information was visualized in a line plot as the previous study. As the last subset of data information on canceled plays could be excluded since all values were null.

## Results 

### 1- Theater campaigns outcomes based on launch date

The most relevant observations found on the outcome vs launch date table and chart are that most of the theater kickstarters were launched in the quarter of may, june, july & august. Also most of successful campaigns were launched in the same quarter, specially in the months of may and june. Last quarter of the year seems the slowest season for theater activity. 

### 2 Plays campaigns outcomes based on funding goals 

As a conclusion we can observe that lower monetary amounts increase the probability of being a successful campaign. Funding goals below 5000 dollars contain the larger amounts of successful campaigns. Goals between 15000 & 19999 seem to have the same amount of successful and failed play kickstarters.
